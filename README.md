# 3D Models for BYOPuppet!

This is a repository of files dedicated towards 3D printing puppet and automaton parts. Models are stored in real world (1x) scale. STL units are millimeters.

## Directory Structure

Each 3D models was originally designed to meet the production process of a given 3D printing technology. 
3D models are organized in folders according to their recommended printing method.



## 3D Printing 

* **FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling, also known as FFF or Fused Filament Fabrication)**
<br>

<br>
The most common 3D printing technology of desktop printers. Plastic filament is extruded through a heated nozzle that then deposits material.
Common examples include Makerbot, Ultimkaer, and RepRap.
<br>

* **SLS (Selective Laser Sintering)**

<br>
Select Laser Sintering uses a laser to fuse powdered material to create a solid object.  Unlike other additive manufacturing such as FDM and SLA (stereolithography), SLS does not require special support structures to fabricate overhanging designs.
