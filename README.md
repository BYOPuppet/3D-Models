BYOPuppet is an opensource catalog of 3D printed joints, puppet parts, and resources with a community of artists interested in sharing their process and exploring how 3D printing and CAD can be applied to puppetry. 

## Motivation

Artists often wear many hats when creating a show: playwright, performer, sculptor, set designer, director, character designer, costume designer, lighting...etc.  

With so many disciplines applied towards an artistic production under typically limited time and budget, the need for a centralized resource to simplify the construction process became clear. 

## Solution

BYOPuppet is a project that aims to 

* Provide artists a library of 3D printable files, assembly instructions, and more that can be applied and modified towards, but not limited to, puppet construction. 

* Offer a place where artists can upload and share modified files created from the original designs created by Laurie Berenhaus. Such modifications may include updates that:
    * allow designs to be printed in a different material or printing process, from the original
    * personalize designs to accomodate specific characters, aesthetics, movement, etc required for a given production or even simply personal experimentation
    * and more

## Contributing

If you want to add file modifications, assembly documentation, etc. from your own work and experimentation, you need to request access at the **Contributor** level. An Admin will grant you permission as soon as they are able. If you join as an **Observer/User** , you won't get to see work added, it'll just add BYOPuppet to your Dashboard.

## 3D Models

* Models are stored in real world (1x) scale. STL units are millimeters.
* Each 3D models was originally designed to meet the production process of a given 3D printing technology. 
* 3D models are organized in folders according to their recommended printing method.
    * **FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling, also known as FFF or Fused Filament Fabrication)**

<br>
The most common 3D printing technology of desktop printers. Plastic filament is extruded through a heated nozzle that then deposits material.
Common examples include Makerbot, Ultimkaer, and RepRap.

    * **SLS (Selective Laser Sintering)**

<br>
Select Laser Sintering uses a laser to fuse powdered material to create a solid object.  Unlike other additive manufacturing such as FDM and SLA (stereolithography), SLS does not require special support structures to fabricate overhanging designs.

## Project Tutorials

* Projects may reference files (ex. balljoint_1half_PVCfit.stl ), however downloadable files will remain in their respective folder.
